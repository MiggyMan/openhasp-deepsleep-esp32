A customisation for openhasp (built agains 	0.7.0-rc8) on esp32 (specifically the sunton-8048 and 4827 boards), with this modification the short idle will dim the screen and long idle will put the unit into deep sleep with a 5m timer and pin trigger (both can be changed easily) the reason for both is the battery board these screens will be attached to will feature a MAX16054AZT on/off controller so that after 5m of not being used the system can power itself off (because while deep sleep saves power, being off saves more :D), this is handled in check_for_powerdown and just brings the clear pin of the MAX16054AZT high to shut power off to the board.
